# neuronStim

This repository provides code for the analyses of a neuron excitation presented in the manuscript submitted to PNAS.  

The main m.file executes simulations on the stimulation of a neuron. The execution requires a definition of the so-called control signalâ€“induced current in a cell. Here, we consider a current imported from the enclosed .xlsx file.
